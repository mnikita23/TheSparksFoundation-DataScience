The algorithm learns from the input-output pairs in the training set and generalizes its knowledge to make predictions on new, unseen data. For instance, in a sales context, we could use historical sales data (input) and corresponding factors like advertising spend, seasonality, and pricing (features) to predict future sales (output). Common algorithms for this task include linear regression for continuous outcomes and decision trees for categorical outcomes.

A common task is clustering, where data points are grouped into clusters based on similarity. For example, in customer segmentation, we might use unsupervised learning to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. The algorithm discovers these groupings without being explicitly told which group each data point belongs to. K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering are popular algorithms for this task.

It involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data through visualizations and statistical summaries. For instance, EDA might reveal seasonal trends in sales, correlations between different products, or the impact of promotions on customer behavior. By exploring the data visually, analysts can gain insights that inform strategic decisions such as inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.

This analysis can help understand the nature of terrorist attacks, their frequency, location, and the groups involved. EDA might reveal trends over time, hotspots of terrorist activity, or common tactics used by terrorist groups. By gaining a deeper understanding of these patterns, policymakers and security agencies can develop more effective counterterrorism strategies.
